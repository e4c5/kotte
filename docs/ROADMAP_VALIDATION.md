## Milestone A — Stop the bleeding

| Ticket | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|

## Milestone C — Make it a graph product

| Ticket | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **C1** — CodeMirror 6 Cypher editor | ✅ Confirmed | `QueryEditor.tsx` imports `CodeMirror` from `@uiw/react-codemirror` (line 2) and `getExtensions` from `@neo4j-cypher/codemirror` (line 4); CodeMirror component used at line 287 |

## Pending items (not validated — not marked complete)

The following remain open and were not evaluated:

- **A2 test** — `TabBar.test.tsx` test for unpinning (ROADMAP body says to add it; not checked)
- **C2.4** — Canvas/Pixi fallback (not started)
- **C2.5** — Minimap (not started)
- **C2.6** — Lasso multi-select (not started)
- **C3–C7** — Streaming, schema sidebar, saved queries, read-only mode, expand options popover
- **D1–D6** — Multi-user, multi-tenant, observability features

---

## Follow-up items noted in ROADMAP but not yet ticketed

1. **`Settings.cors_origins` validator** — `CORS_ORIGINS` in `CONFIGURATION.md` documents comma-separated form, but pydantic-settings requires JSON-array form. A `field_validator` that accepts both is tracked but has no ticket.
2. **`RUN_MIGRATIONS=true` entrypoint hook** — For single-DB deployments wanting automatic migration on startup. No ticket yet.
3. **Deeper light-mode repaint** — A1 repainted shell surfaces; leaf components (`TableView`, `QueryEditor`, `GraphView`, `ConnectionPage`, `LoginPage`, `SettingsModal` inputs) still use hardcoded dark palette. Deferred as a design exercise, not tracked.
4. **Rate-limit 429 JSON response** — When per-IP or per-user cap fires from `BaseHTTPMiddleware`, the result is currently a 500 in production rather than a clean 429 JSON response. Fix is to return `JSONResponse(status_code=429)` directly. Tracked separately.
